# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Challenges in This Course

There are two types of Challenges in this course. Each one is designed to prepare you for a scenario that you're likely to encounter as a web developer.

### What was done

As a developer I looked over someone elses code and revised it to be more accesable with senimatic elements. It was a challenge for me to make these changes without changing the entire point of the HTML.

#### What I noticed

With my first look of the code there were a lot of <div> elements and many class attributes.

##### What ive learned

How to revise code without changing the function of the code. Just making it cleaner and easier to read and function.
